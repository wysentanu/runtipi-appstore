# Runtipi Appstore

This repository is my personal, opinionated version of the official Runtipi appstore, containing various applications configured to suit my own homelab setup.

> [!WARNING]
> This is a private repository tailored for my personal use. You are free to use it in your own environment, but I cannot provide support, and I am not responsible for any data loss or issues resulting from updates to any applications in this repository.

## Apps Policy

Because this is a privately curated repository, I do not accept feature requests or app addition requests. If you wish to make modifications, feel free to fork the repository and maintain your own version. Please note that applications may be removed at any time without notice.
